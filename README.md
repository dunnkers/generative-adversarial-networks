# Painting Van Gogh's using Generative Adversarial Networks
Deep Learning (20/21) `WMAI017-05.2020-2021.2A`

Tries painting new Van Gogh's using [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661). Uses [this](https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx/van-gogh-paintings) dataset.

## Dataset
To download the dataset on either your computer or on Peregrine:

1. Follow the setup from the [official Kaggle API repo](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api#api-credentials). Make sure `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` exists.

2. Execute

```shell
pip install kaggle
data_dir=./dataset
kaggle datasets download -p $data_dir ipythonx/van-gogh-paintings
unzip -n $data_dir/van-gogh-paintings.zip -d $data_dir
```

The dataset will now be available in `data_dir` üí™üèª.

‚Üí in the case of Peregrine, it is recommended to set `data_dir` to somewhere in `/data/<s_number>/`.

### Data augmentation
Although Van Gogh was a very productive painter, training a GAN still requires some more images. Follow the relevant instructions in the `v0` directory to augment the dataset.

## Training
Training can be done with DCGAN or StyleGAN. See `v0` for instructions on training DCGAN, and `stylegan` for instructions on training StyleGAN.

_Note_: The `ppgn` directory contains code for the Plug and Play network and is there for archival purposes; it is something we eventually decided to discontinue.
